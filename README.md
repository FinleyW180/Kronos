# Syndrome Main Computer ("The Incredibles")

I am a big fan of "The Incredibles" movie (2004), and I've always been fascinated by the [user interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRPI3lSACFc) Syndrome had on his computer in the giant room: for this reason I decided to replicate it rather quickly as a web application.

_Careful: this is a `work in progress` and is adapted for 16:9 displays and not for mobile devices. I will adapt it for smaller displays as soon as I can._

> This is a reproduction of Syndrome's main computer from "*The Incredibles*" movie (2004).
